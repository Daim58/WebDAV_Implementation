# WebDAV_Implementation

There's no scrutinizing that the WebDAV protocol delivers for accessing remote repositories. WebDAV broadens the HTTP headers to communicate with a server. In the presented implementation of the protocol, the files from a local directory are made accessible to the user remotely. To do so, a WebDav client and a WebDav server are made. The WebDav client, here, is essentially the UI created using React-TypeScript and the WebDav server has been written in Golang. The codes give the provision to remotely list, download and delete the files from the specified directory to the users. TypeScript functions are created to add the mentioned functionalities and aid in the API calls between the client and the server.
